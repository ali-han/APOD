  "explanation": "Tonight, if you can see the stars of the Big Dipper, then you can find comet Lemmon in your evening sky.  After sunset, look for the faint but extended comet above your northwestern horizon -- but below the handle of the famous celestial kitchen utensil of the north. It might be easier to see this visitor to the inner Solar System through your camera phone, which is better at picking up faint objects.  Either way, look for a fuzzy green 'star' with a tail, though probably not so long a tail as in this impressive snapshot taken over Se\u010d Lake in the Czech Republic two nights ago. Recent photographs of C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) often show a detailed and changing ion tail which extends farther than the eye can follow.  This Sun-orbiting comet is now near its closest approach to Earth  and will pass its closest to the Sun in early November.",
